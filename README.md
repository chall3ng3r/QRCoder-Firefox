# QRCoder for Firefox
Quickly get QR Code of currently open page. WebExtension / Firefox version

My original idea of quickly getting QR code from the currently open page was using JS code in bookmark, published on my blog at https://www.orison.biz/blogs/chall3ng3r/2018/05/qr-coder-version-2/

Now newer versions of browsers don't allow this specifically on mobile devices. So, I finally decided to write my first brower extension.
